\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
I would like to have an advanced degree.

\section{Background}
I should have read the background literature before doing my research, but oh well.
I think rockets are cool.
Here's a rocket (Figure~\ref{figure:bigolrocket})!

\section{Research Questions}
It is important to have clearly defined research questions, otherwise you won't have anything to explicitly ignore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is my purpose?
    \item What is the fastest path to a degree?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
I will write the greatest dissertation ever.
